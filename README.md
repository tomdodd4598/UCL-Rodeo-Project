UCL Project: The Rodeo Algorithm
================================


Summary
-------

A repository holding most code, data and graphics, apart from the [DoddQ](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/doddq) library and [Rodeo Arena](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/rodeo-arena) script, used as part of a UCL Quantum Technologies MSc project on the properties of the [rodeo algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04092) of Choi et al.

The final project report is also available as a PDF, and the Overleaf LaTeX project can be viewed [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbyjvfvyvbrv).

My project supervisor was the wonderfully amiable and percipient [Adam Callison](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/iris-profile-adam-callison).

Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/UCL-Rodeo-Project/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
